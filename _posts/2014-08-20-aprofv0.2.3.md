Changes in the minor release

1. feature: aprof now expects and handles multiple files in the call stack correctly. This happens when you e.g. source files or use the clipboard - in these cases your source file is not the only file in the call stack. This adaptation is the first step forward toward aprof integration with .Rnw and Rmd files. 

## Installation

See the release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aprof/index.html)!

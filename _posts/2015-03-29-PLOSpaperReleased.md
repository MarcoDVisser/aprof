title: Yale short workshop on code efficiency
---

Excited to see our paper on code efficiency in the biological sciences released. The paper contains:

1. A gentle overview of high perforance computing aimed at biologists using R. [Download the open access paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004140)

2. Parallel computing,  calling C in R, and Rcpp examples (with the latter two recommended for advanced R users only). [Download the appendices](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004140#sec017)

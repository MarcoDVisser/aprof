title: Yale short workshop on code efficiency
---

Happy to give a short workshop on code efficiency in R.

Participants may choose between the following short tutorials:

1. Profiling in R, with a bootstrap example (recommended focus). [Download](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof/blob/gh-pages/pdfs/IntroProfiling&Optimization.pdf?raw=true)

2. Parallel computing, extending the bootstrap example (for those interested). [Download](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof/blob/gh-pages/pdfs/IntroParallelComputingR.pdf?raw=true)
3.
Getting ready to call C in R (recommended for advanced R users only). [Download](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof/blob/gh-pages/pdfs/IntroExtendingRwithC.pdf?raw=true)

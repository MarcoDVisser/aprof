Changes in the new release

1. Fixed a bug which was kindly report by Mark Miller. A regex did not recognize the correct number of repeating strings of digits. This cause the identification of memory statistics from the profiler output to fail. Now fixed by explicitly stating the repeating pattern.  


## Installation

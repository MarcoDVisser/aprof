Changes in the new release

1. Fixed the bug which was kindly reported by Mark Miller. In short, a regex did not recognize the correct number of repeating strings of digits (in the memory profiling output) . This caused the identification of memory statistics from the profiler output to fail. Now fixed by explicitly stating the repeating pattern.  


## Installation

Release on [GITHUB](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof). CRAN release to follow very soon.

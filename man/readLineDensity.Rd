\usage{
readLineDensity(aprofobject = NULL, Memprof = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{aprofobject}{An object returned by \code{aprof}, which
contains the stack calls sampled by the R profiler.}

\item{Memprof}{Logical. Should the function return information
specific to memory profiling with memory use per line in MB?
Otherwise, the default is to return line call density and execution time
per line.}
}
\description{
Reads and calculates the line density (in execution time or memory)
of an aprof object returned by the \code{aprof} function.
If a sourcefile was not specified in the aprof object, then the first file
within the profiling information is assumed to be the source.

Amdahl's profiler, directed optimization.

Amdahl's profiler, directed optimization. Assists the evaluation of whether and where to focus code optimization, using [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law) and visual aids based on line profiling. Amdahl's profiler organises profiling output files, including memory profiling, in a visually appealing way. It is meant to help to balance development vs. execution time by helping to identify the most promising sections of code to optimize and projecting potential gains. The package is an addition to R's standard profiling tools and is not a wrapper for them.

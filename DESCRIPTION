Title: Amdahl's profiler, directed optimization made easy.
Version: 0.2.4

Description: Assists the evaluation of whether and
    where to focus code optimization, using Amdahl's law and visual aids
    based on line profiling. Amdahl's profiler organises profiling output
    files (will soon include memory profiling) in a visually appealing
    way. It is meant to help to balance development vs. execution time
    by helping to identify the most promising sections of code to
    optimize and projecting potential gains. The package is an addition
    to R's standard profiling tools and is not a wrapper for them.

Description: Assists the evaluation of whether and
    where to focus code optimization, using Amdahl's
    law and visual aids based on line profiling. The package aprof is
    an addition to R's standard profiling tools and is not a
    wrapper for them. Amdahl's profiler organises profiling output
    files (will will include memory profiling) in a visually appealing
    way and helps to identify the most promising sections of code to
    optimize. It is meant to help to balance development vs. execution time.

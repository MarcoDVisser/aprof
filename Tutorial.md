title: Tutorial - High performance computing for Biologists
---

Computing is central to modern science, [this article provides a gentle introduction to high performance computing for any-level R users.](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004140).

A detailed tutorial, suitable for classroom use, provinding step-by-step explanations of profiling (using aprof), parallel computing and calling C from R is provided in the [supplemental material](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004140#sec017).
